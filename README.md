| Field                | Type                         | Notes                                               |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |

## üéØ Behavior Logic

1. **On Submit**:

   - Validate required fields (message + time).
   - Save all data to local storage (AsyncStorage).
   - Schedule the notification using:

     ```js
     Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync();
     ```

   - Ensure notifications are properly configured for **iOS only**.

2. **Confirmation**:

   - Show a toast/alert saying:

     > _"Reminder saved. We'll nudge you at the right time."_

3. **Reminder Object Example (for local storage)**:

```js
{
  id: 'uuid',
  message: 'Stay grounded.',
  frequency: 'Daily',
  time: '08:00',
  emoji: 'üå±'
}
```

---

## üí° iOS-Only Notes

- Use `expo-notifications` with iOS scheduling APIs.
- Handle cases where notification permissions are not granted:
- Show alert modal with button: _"Go to Settings"_.

---

## üñåÔ∏è Design

- iOS-like modal appearance with rounded corners and padding.
- Soft shadows, pastel backgrounds.
- Use large title: **‚ÄúCreate Your Reminder‚Äù**
- Segments and inputs should follow iOS native visual styles.

---

## ‚úÖ Completion Criteria

- User can open the modal.
- Fill and submit the form.
- Reminder is saved and scheduled.
- UX feedback is shown on success.

---

### ‚úÖ Notification Frequency Management

This section describes the implementation of the **Notification Frequency Management** block on the Notifications Page. This block should appear **above the ‚ÄúYour Custom Reminders‚Äù section** and follow similar layout, styling, and data handling logic already used for the Custom Reminders section.

---

## üß≠ Placement

- **Position**: Place this section **above** the ‚ÄúYour Custom Reminders‚Äù block.
- Keep both sections visually distinct but part of the same page layout.

---

## üì¶ Section Details

- **Section Label:**
  `üîî Notify me every:`

- **UI Component:**
  Use a **horizontal pill-style selector** (preferred) or dropdown if needed:

  ```
  [15 min] [30 min] [45 min] (default) [1 hr] [2 hrs]
  ```

- **Helper Note below selector:**

  > _"You‚Äôll receive a gentle nudge if you‚Äôve been mindlessly scrolling."_

- **UI Design Notes:**

  - Pills should be rounded, soft-colored (e.g. glassy pastel).
  - Selected pill has subtle glow or filled background.
  - Slight elevation/shadow on press.
  - Add smooth animation on selection.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Behavior Logic

- Tapping on a new frequency:

  - Immediately cancels and resets scheduled notifications using `expo-notifications`.
  - Update the user's notification frequency in persistent storage (`AsyncStorage`).
  - Cursor should re-use the same local state/store approach as used in ‚ÄúYour Custom Reminders" making sure it does not affect the notifications in ‚ÄúYour Custom Reminders" section.

---

## üìù Data Sample

```js
// Store selected frequency in local app storage
{
  notificationFrequency: "45 min";
}
```

---

## ‚úÖ Completion Criteria

- Section appears above "Your Custom Reminders".
- Pills are styled, tappable, and reflect selected value.
- Helper text is visible and aligned with the rest of the UI.
- Frequency is saved to persistent storage.
- Notifications reschedule correctly when selection changes.

---

## ‚úÖ Feature: **Global Notifications Toggle**

This toggle controls **both**:

- "Notify Me Every" (nudge frequency)
- "Your Custom Reminders"

---

### üìÑ README-style Documentation for the Feature

**üìå Feature Name:** Global Notifications Toggle
**üìç Location:** Notifications screen (top or bottom, based on state)

---

### üß© Purpose

Let users globally enable or disable all mindful notifications without deleting or reconfiguring existing preferences.

---

### üñºÔ∏è Design Instructions

**Toggle States:**

#### 1. **When notifications are disabled:**

- üîò Show toggle **at the top** of the Notifications screen (just below the page title).
- Show text:

  > üîï **Notifications are Off**
  > Enable reminders when you're ready for mindful nudges.

- Toggle label: `Enable Notifications`

#### 2. **When notifications are enabled:**

- üîò Show toggle **at the bottom** of the Notifications screen.
- Text (above the toggle):

  > ‚úÖ **Notifications are On**
  > You‚Äôll receive nudges and custom reminders as configured.

- Toggle label: `Disable Notifications`

**üì± Styling Consistency:**

- Use the same toggle switch style as in the rest of your app (rounded, animated, native feel).
- Add a soft shadow box or rounded background to make the toggle section feel deliberate (like other pages‚Äô cards).
- Use emoji and subtle accent colors for each state.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Logic Instructions

1. Use a boolean flag in local storage:

   ```ts
   notificationsEnabled = true | false;
   ```

2. If `notificationsEnabled === false`, hide:

   - "Notify Me Every" section
   - "Your Custom Reminders" section (including Add button)

3. When toggled:

   - If turning **off**, cancel all scheduled Expo notifications (`Notifications.cancelAllScheduledNotificationsAsync()`).
   - If turning **on**, reschedule according to:

     - Frequency selected
     - All saved custom reminders

4. Maintain layout:

   - Animate toggle‚Äôs position change (top <-> bottom)
   - Show/hide other sections with a fade or slide-in animation

# ‚ú® Notifications Page Redesign ‚Äì Visual Only (No Logic Changes)

This section outlines visual and UX improvements to the **Notifications Page**. Maintain the existing notification logic and user behavior, but **enhance clarity, warmth, and emotional connection** in design.

---

## üîπ 1. Rebrand Section Heading

**Current Label:** ‚ÄúNotify Me Every‚Äù

**New Label:** `Mindful Nudges`

**Subtitle (smaller font, muted):**

> ‚ÄúGentle reminders to pause, breathe, and check in with yourself.‚Äù

- Typography: Use semi-bold title font with rounded letter spacing
- Color: Soft charcoal for title, faded pastel blue or lavender for subtitle

---

## üîπ 2. Add Explainer Mini-Card (Above Frequency Selector)

### Text:

```plaintext
üßò Why These Reminders?
We‚Äôll gently nudge you to pause and take a mindful breath ‚Äî especially when you might be scrolling without realizing.
```

### Style:

- Rounded corners (16px radius)
- Background: pastel beige, soft lavender, or white with blur (glassmorphism)
- Font size: Medium (readable)
- Emoji anchored left
- Animation: Fade + gentle scale-in on mount

**Optional Expansion Behavior:**

- Tapping the card could expand into a small visual (optional, future-ready)

---

## üîπ 3. Chip Selector Upgrade ‚Äì Scrollable Frequency Selector

### Changes to Selector UI:

- Convert current dropdown or pill row into a **horizontal chip carousel**
- Each chip includes:

| Time   | Sub-Label        |
| ------ | ---------------- |
| 15 min | ‚ÄúVery Often‚Äù     |
| 30 min | ‚ÄúOften‚Äù          |
| 45 min | ‚ÄúBalanced‚Äù       |
| 1 hr   | ‚ÄúGentle Cadence‚Äù |
| 2 hrs  | ‚ÄúRarely‚Äù         |

### Style Enhancements:

- Chips have a soft shadow and glowing border when selected
- Light bounce or pop animation on tap
- Selected pill animates with subtle pulse (XP-style glow)

---

## üîπ 4. Add Top Hero Visual / Header Graphic

### Image Path:

`/assets/preBuiltTasks/notification-page.png`

### Placement:

- At the very top of Notifications Page, **above "Mindful Nudges"**
- Use a rounded rectangular container (width: 90% of screen)
- Add soft drop shadow
- Add margin below (at least 24px)

---

## üßò Summary of Spacing & Flow

- Start with hero image
- Then show ‚ÄúMindful Nudges‚Äù title and subtitle
- Add explainer card next
- Add horizontal chip carousel
- Add any toggles or control features
- Ensure a **clean breathing layout** with:

  - Minimum 24px vertical space between blocks
  - Avoid color stacking ‚Äî use whitespace or soft dividers

---

## üö´ DO NOT:

- Change any logic
- Alter how notifications are scheduled or stored
- Affect the existing toggle behavior for enabling/disabling reminders

```

```

üò¥ Sleep Mode ‚Äî Feature Specification for Notifications Page
üß† Purpose:
To allow users to set a sleep window (Start Time ‚Üí End Time) during which no notifications will be delivered.

‚úÖ Design & UX:
üìç Position:
Place the Sleep Mode section below the "Mindful Nudges" (Notify Me Every) section and above any toggle or footer.

üõèÔ∏è Section Title:
‚ÄúSleep Mode‚Äù

Subtitle: ‚ÄúPause notifications during your rest hours.‚Äù

‚è∞ UI Elements:
Label: Start Time
‚Üí iOS-style time picker (or 12hr/24hr dropdown selector)

Label: End Time
‚Üí Same time picker

Toggle Switch:
üõè Enable Sleep Mode

üåô Visual Design:
Rounded glassy container with soft pastel background (beige / lavender fade)

Icon suggestion: üõå or üåô beside title

Light sleep-wave divider between this and other sections

üí° Behavior Logic:
If Sleep Mode is enabled, then:

Before sending any notification, check:

js
const now = new Date();
const sleepStart = new Date(); // set to selected start hour
const sleepEnd = new Date(); // set to selected end hour

If current time falls between those, suppress notification.

Persist sleep start/end and toggle status using AsyncStorage.

Optional: On sleep time overlap (e.g., 10 PM to 7 AM across midnight), handle wrap-around logic properly.
